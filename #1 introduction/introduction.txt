#1.4 Why JS??
1. Why the JavaSCript is so broadly used??
2. There are so many things can do with JS.

JavaScript is the only programming language in Front-End.

Browser understands HTML,CSS,JavaScript we don't have to download JS.
It is already there in our computer.
JavaScript cannot be replaced by some other programming language.

Let's see what JavaScript can do. Let's see the limits, how much we can push with JavaScript.

1. three.js
➤ 'three.js' is library, allows us to build 3D stuff with JavaScript.
➤ We can make simply interactive game with JavaScript.
(To make better looking, we need extra skills)

2. React Native
if you want to learn more about JS, move on to frame work ➤ React Native.
➤ we can build andriod application with React Native.

3. ELECTRON
Can make destop application with HTML, CSS, JS.
ex) Visual Studio Code is also made by ELECTRON. (Twitch, Slack...)

Today, we can use JS in Back-End also.
(we can build all website with using only JS)

4. socket.io
if you are interested in 3D and real-time stuff, you can use JS.

5. ml5js.org
