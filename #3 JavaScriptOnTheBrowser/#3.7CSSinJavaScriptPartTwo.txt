We have to choose proper tool, method for doing a job.
We changed style from JavaScript, But it is not proper way.
Right tool for style is CSS, for animation is JavaScript.
<HTML>
<div class="hello">
      <h1 class="sexy-font">Click me!</h1>
</div>

<CSS>
.active {
  color: tomato;
}

.sexy-font {
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Oxygen,
    Ubuntu, Cantarell, "Open Sans", "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
}

<JavaScript>
const h1 = document.querySelector("div.hello:first-child h1");

function handleTitleClick() {
    const clickedClass = "active sexy-font"
    if (h1.className === clickedClass) {
        h1.className = "";
    } else {
        h1.className = clickedClass;
    }
}
 //NOW, we are operating JS and Css in the right way with less codes.
 //But, there are still some of points that we can improve.

 //❗️Cleaning Code❗️
 //❗️point01. String "active" is using twice. (or more depends on case)
 // we better save "active" in variable to prevent error.
 
 //❗️point02. Bug
 // What if we already have className on elements before we update from JavaScript??
 // New ClassName from JavaScript doesn't give a shit about old one and just delete.
 // We have to add old className to variable every single time if we want to add className from HTML.
 // ex) const clickedClass = "active sexy-font"

h1.addEventListener("click", handleTitleClick);
